# Open Rocket Project

This open-source rocketry design focuses on building a simple yet functional model rocket. The rocket integrates essential components for propulsion, stability, recovery, and tracking.

## Components

- **C-60 Motor Cartridge**: Provides propulsion for the rocket.
- **PVC Body Tube**: Ensures structural integrity.
- **Polyvinyl Nose Cone**: Optimized for aerodynamics.
- **Shock Chord**:Shock absorber.
- **Centering rings**: Stable Motor Alignment.
- - **Bulk head**:Sealing compartment for two-stage recovery
- **Trapezoidal Cardboard Fins**: Designed for stability during flight.
- **36.7-Inch Parachute**: For controlled descent and safe recovery.
- **GPS Tracker**: Embedded in the nose cone for real-time location tracking during flight.

## Features

- **Open-source design**: Available for collaboration and improvements by the rocketry community.
- **Flight Stability**: The rocket’s aerodynamic components and fins ensure steady flight.
- **Recovery System**: A parachute allows for a safe descent and easy recovery after the flight.
- **Tracking**: A GPS tracker allows for the monitoring of the rocket's location for efficient retrieval.

## Installation & Usage

1. **Assemble the rocket**: 
   - Attach the C-60 motor cartridge to the rocket body.
   - Install the polyvinyl nose cone and trapezoidal fins.
   - Ensure the parachute is properly packed for deployment.
   - Insert the GPS tracker into the nose cone.

2. **Launch**: Ensure safe launch conditions and monitor the rocket’s trajectory using the GPS tracker.

3. **Recovery**: After deployment of the parachute, retrieve the rocket using the GPS location.
